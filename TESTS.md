In order to successfully run the unit tests, you will need the Credit Key API source installed locally and your local development copy of the API (puma) running.

Set the path to the API source using the environment variable ```CREDITKEY_SOURCE_PATH```.  This path is used to run rake tasks from that directory.

Run the unit tests with:

```
creditkey-php% ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
